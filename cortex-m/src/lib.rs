//! Low level access to Cortex-M processors
//!
//! This crate provides:
//!
//! - Access to core peripherals like NVIC, SCB and SysTick.
//! - Access to core registers like CONTROL, MSP and PSR.
//! - Interrupt manipulation mechanisms
//! - Safe wrappers around Cortex-M specific instructions like `bkpt`
//!
//! # Optional features
//!
//! ## `critical-section-single-core`
//!
//! This feature enables a [`critical-section`](https://github.com/rust-embedded/critical-section)
//! implementation suitable for single-core targets, based on disabling interrupts globally.
//!
//! It is **unsound** to enable it on multi-core targets or for code running in unprivileged mode,
//! and may cause functional problems in systems where some interrupts must not be disabled
//! or critical sections are managed as part of an RTOS. In these cases, you should use
//! a target-specific implementation instead, typically provided by a HAL or RTOS crate.
//!
//! ## `cm7-r0p1`
//!
//! This feature enables workarounds for errata found on Cortex-M7 chips with revision r0p1. Some
//! functions in this crate only work correctly on those chips if this Cargo feature is enabled
//! (the functions are documented accordingly).
//!
//! # Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV)
//!
//! This crate is guaranteed to compile on stable Rust 1.60 and up. It *might*
//! compile with older versions but that may change in any new patch release.

// If you do add a function that's not supposed to be #[inline], you can add

// This should be done in case of:

//  - A generated #[derive(Debug)] function (in which case the attribute needs

//! Low level access to Cortex-M processors
//!
//! This crate provides:
//!
//! - Access to core peripherals like NVIC, SCB and SysTick.
//! - Access to core registers like CONTROL, MSP and PSR.
//! - Interrupt manipulation mechanisms
//! - Safe wrappers around Cortex-M specific instructions like `bkpt`
//!
//! # Optional features
//!
//! ## `inline-asm`
//!
//! When this feature is enabled the implementation of all the functions inside the `asm` and
//! `register` modules use inline assembly (`asm!`) instead of external assembly (FFI into separate
//! assembly files pre-compiled using `arm-none-eabi-gcc`). The advantages of enabling `inline-asm`
//! are:
//!
//! - Reduced overhead. FFI eliminates the possibility of inlining so all operations include a
//!   function call overhead when `inline-asm` is not enabled.
//!
//! - Some of the `register` API only becomes available only when `inline-asm` is enabled. Check the
//!   API docs for details.
//!
//! The disadvantage is that `inline-asm` requires a Rust version at least 1.59 to use the `asm!()`
//! macro. In the future 0.8 and above versions of `cortex-m`, this feature will always be enabled.
//!
//! ## `critical-section-single-core`
//!
//! This feature enables a [`critical-section`](https://github.com/rust-embedded/critical-section)
//! implementation suitable for single-core targets, based on disabling interrupts globally.
//!
//! It is **unsound** to enable it on multi-core targets or for code running in unprivileged mode,
//! and may cause functional problems in systems where some interrupts must not be disabled
//! or critical sections are managed as part of an RTOS. In these cases, you should use
//! a target-specific implementation instead, typically provided by a HAL or RTOS crate.
//!
//! The critical section has been optimized to block interrupts for as few cycles as possible,
//! but -- due to `critical-section` implementation details -- incurs branches in a normal build
//! configuration. For minimal interrupt latency, you can achieve inlining by enabling
//! [linker-plugin-based LTO](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/linker-plugin-lto.html).
//!
//! ## `cm7-r0p1`
//!
//! This feature enables workarounds for errata found on Cortex-M7 chips with revision r0p1. Some
//! functions in this crate only work correctly on those chips if this Cargo feature is enabled
//! (the functions are documented accordingly).
//!
//! ## `linker-plugin-lto`
//!
//! This feature links against prebuilt assembly blobs that are compatible with [Linker-Plugin LTO].
//! This allows inlining assembly routines into the caller, even without the `inline-asm` feature,
//! and works on stable Rust (but note the drawbacks below!).
//!
//! If you want to use this feature, you need to be aware of a few things:
//!
//! - You need to make sure that `-Clinker-plugin-lto` is passed to rustc. Please refer to the
//!   [Linker-Plugin LTO] documentation for details.
//!
//! - You have to use a Rust version whose LLVM version is compatible with the toolchain in
//!   `asm-toolchain`.
//!
//! - Due to a [Rust bug][rust-lang/rust#75940] in compiler versions **before 1.49**, this option
//!   does not work with optimization levels `s` and `z`.
//!

//! # Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV)
//!
//! This crate is guaranteed to compile on stable Rust 1.61 and up. It *might*
//! compile with older versions but that may change in any new patch release.

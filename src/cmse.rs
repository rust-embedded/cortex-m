//! Cortex-M Security Extensions
//!
//! This module provides several helper functions to support Armv8-M and Armv8.1-M Security
//! Extensions.
//! Most of this implementation is directly inspired by the "Armv8-M Security Extensions:
//! Requirements on Development Tools" document available here:
//! https://developer.arm.com/docs/ecm0359818/latest
//!
//! Please note that the TT instructions support as described part 4 of the document linked above is
//! not part of CMSE but is still present in this module. The TT instructions return the
//! configuration of the Memory Protection Unit at an address.
//!
//! # Notes
//!
//! * Non-Secure Unprivileged code will always read zeroes from TestTarget and should not use it.
//! * Non-Secure Privileged code can check current (AccessType::Current) and Non-Secure Unprivileged
//!   accesses (AccessType::Unprivileged).
//! * Secure Unprivileged code can check Non-Secure Unprivileged accesses (AccessType::NonSecure).
//! * Secure Privileged code can check all access types.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```
//! use cortex_m::cmse::{TestTarget, AccessType};
//!
//! // suspect_address was given by Non-Secure to a Secure function to write at it.
//! // But is it allowed to?
//! let suspect_address_test = TestTarget::check(0xDEADBEEF as *mut u32,
//!                                              AccessType::NonSecureUnprivileged);
//! if suspect_address_test.ns_read_and_writable() {
//!     // Non-Secure can not read or write this address!
//! }
//! ```
